# Introduction
This is my code for the eleventh project from React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux). 

# Project Details
The goal of this project was to learn how to use redux with multiple states. We initially started with the counter redux from project 10 and implemented it in the react project. Later we added a login that does not validate the inputs. The goal was to change the navbar based off the loggedin state triggered by the log in button, not to review form validation.

# Skills Learned
- Redux
- Attaching the payload to the action
- Useing Redux Toolkit
- Working with multiple state slices
- Seperating the redux code into multiple files
